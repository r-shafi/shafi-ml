Almost everyone I know that knows JavaScript learned about the <code>for loop</code> at the very beginning of their JS learning path. So I'm assuming you're familiar with it all too well.</p>\n<p>Let's see this in action:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const bigArray = [];\n\nfor (let i = 0; i &#x3C; 1000; i++) {\n  bigArray[i] = i + 1;\n}\n\nconsole.log(bigArray);\n// An array starting at 1 that ends at 1000\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>Here <code>i</code> starts at <strong>0</strong> and ends at <strong>999</strong>, this gives the array a length of 1000.</li>\n<li>For each index of the array, we store <strong>that-index</strong> + <strong>1</strong> to it. Because the specification of this array tells us to return an array beginning at 1.</li>\n<li>If we had not added the 1 with every item of the array, we'd have end up with an array beginning at <strong>0</strong> and ending at <strong>999</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Using the <code>Array.from</code> Method</h3>\n<p>We can return the same array we created with <code>for loop</code> in a much easier way using the <code>Array.from</code> method.</p>\n<p>Let's see this in action:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const numbers = Array.from(\n  { length: 1000 },\n  (item, index) => (item = index + 1)\n);\n\nconsole.log(numbers);\n// we get the same result!\n</code></pre>\n<p>What did we do here?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Array.from() static method creates a new, shallow-copied Array instance from an array-like or iterable object.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>If we pass anything iterable to <code>Array.from</code> it'd return us an array.</li>\n<li>Remember that after everything array is an object in JavaScript and it have some built in property to it.</li>\n<li>So we destructured the length property out of a newly created array and set its value to 1000.</li>\n<li>The <code>Array.from</code> has a built in <code>map function</code> to it.</li>\n<li>We iterate over the array of 1000 items with the <code>map function</code> and pass in the <strong>current item</strong> and the <strong>current index</strong>.</li>\n<li>Finally we set the <strong>index + 1</strong> value to the current item.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That's how we can easily get back an array beginning at a certain number and ending at another.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"December 24, 2020","slug":"/blog/create-array-from-n-to-x","title":"How to Create an Array Containing 1 to N in JavaScript"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/create-array-from-n-to-x"}}
